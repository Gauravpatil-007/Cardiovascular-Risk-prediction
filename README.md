______________________________________________________
The dataset is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes. Variables Each attribute is a potential risk factor. There are both demographic, behavioral, and medical risk factors. We will analyze each feature and understand the different factors in the data which affect our target variable. We will apply different machine learning algorithms for classification to our data which will help to understand which model fits the best and then from that model we can estimate the target variable. ommute on arrival. According to our problem our main aim is to build a predictive model so as to find the number of bikes rented based on the given dataset.
